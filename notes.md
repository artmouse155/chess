## Phase 0: Chess Moves

The tests use a textual representation of a gameboard.

- Uppercase letters are white pieces
- Lowercase letters are black pieces
- Chess positions are given by `(rowsFromBottom,ColumnsFromLeft)`
  - For example, `ChessPosition(5, 4)` refers to the position 5 rows up from the bottom of the board and 4 columns right from the left of the board
